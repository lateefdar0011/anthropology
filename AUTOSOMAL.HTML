  <body><p><h4> Autosomal recessive traits can affect both sexs  in equal proportions and
     can skip  generations. The gene is carried on autosomes. For  expression of recessive
      trait to be displayed to copies of traits or alleles needs to be present , which indicates
       that both  the parents must be at least carriers for the specific traits. Therefore a  recessive
       trait can remain hidden for several generations without displaying the phenotype or diseases.
The trait characteristically appears only in sibs, not in parents, offsprings or other relatives.

Sometimes a rare autosomal recessive trait may occur in families where the parents are
 close ( blood) relatives, who are supposed to inherit the allele from a common ancestor.
 The situation is called consanguinity , marriage between relatives (consangenius marriage) as
   they are often called are important genetically.</h4>
   <h4>Because closely related individuals have a higher chance of carrying the same alleles then
    less closely related individuals. Children from consanguineous marriage are more frequently homozygous
     for various alleles than are  children from other marriages. ancient societies like the pharaohs of
      ancient Egypt and incas of the peru favoured marriage of brothers
    and sisters of the ruling dynasties to keep the Royal Blood pure .These extreme cases of consanguineous
     marriages . in some societies more common types of close consanguinity are observed in cousin marriages.
      Examples of other consanguineous relations are those between uncle or aunt and nephew or niece (third degree)
       between cousins (4th degree) between second cousins (6th dgree). Consanguinity relations are identified by the
        number of steps from common ancestor to only one of the related individuals , namely ,
         the one more remote from him.</h4>
