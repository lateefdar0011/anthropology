    <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
    <p><h4>The feild of Anthropology is basically concerned with both biological and social/cultural
       evolution as well as diversity of Human population throughout the ages.
    For understanding the human genetics one needs to understand about physical anthropology or
     biological anthropology which deals with the the study of human biology,
     evolution of human organisms, the relation between environment and human organisms and genetic variations
     between individuals and groups.</h4></p>
     <p> <h3>we will discuss in this page</h3> <h2>MENDELIAN INHERITANCE</h2><h3>and some of its types</h3>
  <h2>Mendelian INHERITANCE:</h2><br><h4> Mendelian traits or simple inheritance are mainly discreat in nature
     and are controlled by alleles at single genetic locus.Therefore, in humans, traits or disorders that a single
      gene specifies are said to be Mendelian traits. currently more than 4500 human traits are said to be inherited
        as per mandelian principles.
        many of the known Mendelian traits may be classified as disorders as per physical and mental disability.
        however the most prevalent Mendelian disorders are very rere, usually affecting 1 in 10000 births or even less
        than that.<br><hr>Geneticist unlike other, who carried out  on plants or animals, can't have an access over experimental or
         controlled breading. Hence they have to confine their study by observing the mode of inheritance in a pre-digree.
Pedigree is a systematic drawing of an ancestral line of a given individual (both father and mother side ) or family tree of a large
 number of individuals that depict  blood relationship and transmission of inherited traits.
Pedigree can help to determine the genetic basis of a particular trait, especially in humans, where experimental mating is not possible.<br><br>
TYPES OF INHERITANCE:<br><br>
The patterns in which the Mandolin treats appear or transmitted in families are called modes of inheritance on the basis of chromosome
 where genes are located you can find 2 types of inheritance autosomal thats located on the autosomes , sex-chromosomal
  inheritance i.e. located on sex chromosomes , X and Y. Both autosomal and sex-chromosomal inheritance may be sub-divided as
   dominant or recessive inheritance on the basis of expression of alleles. However in respect of Y chromosome there is no such
 subdivision like that described earlier .<br> hance, we have five modes of inheritance
<ol><li><a href="autosomal.html">Autosomal recessive inheritance</a>
 </li>
  <li> autosomal dominant inheritance</li><li> X linked recessive inheritance</li><li> X linked dominant inheritance</li><li>and Y linked inheritance</li>
</ol>.
